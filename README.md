# IdentityServer.Legacy

Easily integrate IdentityServer4 (OpenId Connect) into existing (legacy) applications.

Existing applications often implement only outdated logon dialogs and mechanisms. This package is designed to help bring this to a modern standard, including two factor authentification etc...

Please remain interested.
A first version and documentation are in progress :)
